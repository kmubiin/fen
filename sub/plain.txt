sub/plain.txt
-------------

Make a symbolic link in another sub directory.

    mkdir try/ &&
    cd try/ &&
    ln -s ../plain.txt readme.rst

(P.S.: This seems to work!)

Two differences for this test:

1. The actual file is saved as "plain", instead of
   same filename "readme" for the file and symbolic link
2. reStructuredText file extension (.rst) is used
   instead of Markdown file extension (.md)

If this were seen **formatted** without extra characters,
then symbolic link with some markup file extension works
like actual file!

Yet, this seems limited to "readme per directory" basis on
web repository and *might not* work with other files. Is it?
Self-answer.
