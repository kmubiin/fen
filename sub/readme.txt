## sub/readme.txt

Make a symbolic link to this readme on localhost.

  ln -s readme.txt readme.md

If this were seen **formatted** without extra characters,
then symbolic link with some markup file extension works
like actual file!

Although, this seems limited to readme on web repository and
*might not* work with other files. Is it? Self-answer.
