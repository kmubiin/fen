markup/source.txt
====================

A single text file to experiment markup languages.
Markups are selective and chosen by either compatible or
similar use cases. Subject to personal preference.

This file is shown by one of these symbolic links:

? [Markdown](readme.md)
from the [markup directory](..)

? `reStructuredText <readme.rst>`_
from the `markup directory <..>`_

? link:readme.adoc[AsciiDoc]
from the link:..[markup directory]

--------------------
Title text
--------------------

ATX heading (prefix with/without matching pair):
Markdown, AsciiDoc

Setext heading (underline):
Markdown, reStructuredText

--------------------
Simple text
--------------------

This is a paragraph.

Paragraphs line up on the left, and are normally separated
by blank lines.

Paragraphs indented by some spaces may be:

 literal paragraphs (AsciiDoc)
 indented by at least one space;
 spaces and newlines are preserved;
 or,

    literal blocks or code blocks (Markdown)
    indented by at least four spaces;
    newlines may not be preserved;
    or,

    block quotes (reStructuredText)

        and each block may follow another block.

--------------------
Marker text
--------------------

A thematic break or transition marker is made of horizontal
lines of repeated punctuation characters. That lines up on
the left, and if properly used, found between paragraphs.

``---`` (Markdown, AsciiDoc)

---

``----`` (reStructuredText; delimited block in AsciiDoc)

Repeated punctuation often use hyphen or minus, but some
markup languages may allow or restrict other characters.

``'''`` (AsciiDoc)

'''

``''''`` (reStructuredText)

''''

``___`` (Markdown)

___

``____`` (reStructuredText; block quotes in AsciiDoc)

``***`` (Markdown; invalid in reStructuredText)

``****`` (reStructuredText)

****
