another type of wetland

## Now trying (impromptu)

- markup/source.txt to experiment markup languages

## Test and document

- readme.md has "pretty" markup viewing on the web
- sub/readme.txt with [.md symbolic link](sub/readme.md)
- [relative link](sub) may work with the .md symbolic link
- sub/plain.txt with readme.rst symbolic link may be shown
  "pretty" via [another relative link](sub/try/)

## Test and put aside

- .github/workflows/basic.yml was created by suggested
  minimum configurations to try GitHub Actions
- [off directory](off) with readme was created as
  dependency to limit workflow without deletion

## Anything else

Basic requirements to work with the contents:

- a web repository
- a web browser
- any markup tool or browser extension (optional)

**MUST KNOW**
The "pretty" markup preview is a built-in feature of the
web repository i.e. GitHub. Otherwise, run a self-hosted
repository or use any markup editor to preview contents.

Licensing was never decided for this project, but a
simple attribution would be good enough for personal
and educational use.
